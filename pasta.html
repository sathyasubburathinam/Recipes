        <p>"The dynamic trio of fresh basil pesto, mozzarella cheese, and juicy tomato is reunited once again in an American favorite—pasta salad," says Pepi-Rainbow.<br>"This light and fresh salad is great for a lunch, a side dish, or even a snack."</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup pine nuts, toasted (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <h2>Step1</h2>
        <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.<br>Once the water is boiling, stir in the fusilli, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</p>
        <h2>Step2</h2>
        <p>Place basil, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic into a blender or food processor; cover and chop to a coarse paste. Add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream.<br>Continue processing until a soft paste has formed. Set pesto aside.</p>
        <h2>Step3</h2>
        <p>Combine the cooked pasta, tomatoes, 3 tablespoons Parmesan, mozzarella, and pesto in a large bowl.<br>Season with salt and pepper. Cover bowl, refrigerate to chill for 45 minutes, and serve.</P>
